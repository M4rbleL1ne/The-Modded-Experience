# The Modded Experience
Do you like modded creatures? I love them. Unfortunately, they only appear in their respective modded regions, most of the time. With this mod, some vanilla creatures have a high chance to get replaced by modded ones. Why? Because modding is superior. Requires The M4rblelous Entity Pack and Shrouded Assembly Code.
