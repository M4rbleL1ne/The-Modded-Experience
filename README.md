# The-Modded-Experience
Do you like modded creatures? I love them. Unfortunately, they only appear in their respective modded regions, most of the time. With this mod, some vanilla creatures have a high chance to get replaced by modded ones. Why? Because modding is superior.

**Notes:**
- BepInEx plugin, won't crash if you don't have all the modded creatures it uses;
- Doesn't use all the modded creatures (I can't guess the enum names of the private ones, creatures from patch mods won't be used obviously);
- You might need to sleep in a shelter at least once in a region for the mod's effects to appear;
- You can check the consoleLog.txt to see which modded creatures will be used.
